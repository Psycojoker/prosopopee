# Prosopopee

More or less a small clone of exposure.co in form of a static generator. For
those of you who don't know what exposure.co is, this more or less allows you
to organise you picture in a way that more or less tell a story.

You can find example usages here:

* https://www.thebrownianmovement.org/
* http://outside.browny.pink
* http://such.life

# Why?

I wanted to learn a bit of advanced css and I wanted to self-host my data.

## Requirements

Installation needs Python, pip and virtualenv

    apt-get install python-pip python-virtualenv

Gallery building needs graphicsmagick library

    apt-get install graphicsmagick

## Installation

1. Create a virtualenv, and activate it

```
virtualenv ve
source ve/bin/activate
```

2. Download and install Prosopopee

```
pip install prosopopee
```

## Files organisation

The files organisation is quite simple:

* in the root directory of your project you need a settings.yaml file that will contains the title and subtitle of your gallery
* for each gallery you'll need a folder that also contains a settings.yaml file that will describe how to display the content on your gallery
* and you put the pictures of the gallery inside the gallery folder

### Root settings.yaml

The root settings.yaml should contains 2 keys : one for the title of your website and one for the subtitle. It should looks like that:

```yaml
title: My exploration of the outside world
sub_title: it's a scary place, don't go there
```

It can also optionally contain a menu and global settings.

#### Menu

It is possible to add a menu to your homepage that links to static pages. To do so, add a `menu` key to your `settings.yaml`, for example:

```yaml
menu:
  - about: "About"
  - first_gallery: "My first gallery"
  - http://twitter.com: "Twitter"
```

For example, this could be the content of `settings.yaml` in `about` folder:

```yaml
title: "About"
static: true
public: false
sections:
  - type: text
    text: Some text, HTML <b>is allowed</b>.
```

You can use the `static` option to get a template closer to the one of the
homepage that is better suited for a static page. You'll need to specify
"public: false" if you don't want to list this page on the homepage. On you
case you didn't specified "public: false" you'll **need** to specify a "cover:"
entry like any other gallery.

**NOTE**: except the "static: " option to disepear quite soon for a more
generic approach to "choose your page style".

#### Global settings

Global settings can be set in your root `settings.yaml`, under the `settings` key.

Currently a `gm` settings key allows to customize the default GraphicsMagick's behavior. It looks like :

```yaml
settings:
  gm:
    quality: 75
    auto-orient: True
    strip: True
    resize: 50%
```

The meaning of the currently supported GraphicsMagick's settings is as follows :
* `quality` allows to customize the compression level of thumbnails (between 0 and 100)
* `auto-orient` change the orientation of pictures so they are upright (based on corresponding EXIF tags if present)
* `strip` removes all profiles and text attributes from the image (good for privacy, slightly reduce file size)
* `resize` can be used to resize the fullsize version of pictures. by default, input image size is preserved

Any GraphicsMagick setting can be customized on a per-image basis (either `cover` or `image`, see below).


### Gallery settings.yaml

This settings.yaml will describe:

* the title, subtitle and cover picture of your gallery that will be used on the homepage
* the tags is optional
* if your gallery is public (if not, it will still be built but won't appear on the homepage)
* the date of your gallery: this will be used on the homepage since **galleries are sorted anti chronologically** on it
* the list of sections that will contains your gallery. A section will represent either one picture, a group of pictures or text. The different kind of sections will be explained in the next README section.

Here is an example:

```yaml
title: Gallery title
sub_title: Gallery sub-title
date: 2016-01-15
cover: my_cover_picture.jpg
tags:
  - #yolo
  - #travel
sections:
  - type: full-picture
    image: big_picture.jpg
    text:
      title: Big picture title
      sub_title: Some text
      date: 2016-01-15
  - type: pictures-group
    images:
      -
        - image1.jpg
        - image2.jpg
        - image3.jpg
      -
        - image4.jpg
        - image5.jpg
  - type: text
    text: Some text, HTML <b>is allowed</b>.
  - type: bordered-picture
    image: another_picture.jpg
```

And here is an example or a **private** gallery (notice the <code>public</code> keyword):

```yaml
title: Gallery title
sub_title: Gallery sub-title
date: 2016-01-15
cover: my_cover_picture.jpg
public: false
sections:
    - ...
```

Images go into the `cover` or `image` keys.
Each image individual processing settings can be customized to override the default
GraphicsMagick settings defined (or not) in the root `settings.yaml`.

This is done by putting the image path into a `name` key,
and adding specific processing settings afterwards.

For example, you can replace :

```yaml
image: image1.jpg
```

by :

```yaml
image:
  name: image1.jpg
  quality: 90
  strip: False
  auto-orient: False
```


### Different kind of sections

A gallery is composed of a succession of sections as you can see on this [wonderfully
totally uninteresting example
gallery](http://psycojoker.github.io/prosopopee/first_gallery/) the gallery is
composed of 5 sections:

* a full screen picture with text written on it
* a picture with borders around it
* a group of 5 pictures
* and a fullscreen picture without text on it this time

In your settings.yaml, a section will **always** have a <code>type</code> key
that will describe its kind and additional data. Underneath, the
<code>type</code> key is actually the name of an HTML template and the other
data will be passed to this template.

You can find all the sections templates here: https://github.com/Psycojoker/prosopopee/tree/master/prosopopee/templates/sections

You often have an <code>image</code> key. You need to give it a path to the
actual file. By convention, those files are put inside your gallery folder but
this is not mandatory.

#### Full Screen picture with OR without text on it

This displays a full screen picture as shown in the [example
gallery](http://psycojoker.github.io/prosopopee/first_gallery/) in the first
and last sections. How you should use it:

With text:

```yaml
  - type: full-picture
    image: big_picture.jpg
    text:
      title: Big picture title
      sub_title: Some text
      date: 2016-01-15
```

Without text:

```yaml
  - type: full-picture
    image: big_picture.jpg
```

#### Bordered picture

This displays a centered picture that is surrounded by white (the background) as
shown in the second position of the [example
gallery](http://psycojoker.github.io/prosopopee/first_gallery/).

How to use it:

```yaml
  - type: bordered-picture
    image: another_picture.jpg
```

#### Group of pictures

This displays a group of zoomable pictures on one or multiple lines as shown on
the fourth position (after the text) of the [example
gallery](http://psycojoker.github.io/prosopopee/first_gallery/).

```yaml
  - type: pictures-group
    images:
      -
        - image1.jpg
        - image2.jpg
        - image3.jpg
      -
        - image4.jpg
        - image5.jpg
```

The first level `-` represent a line of pictures.
The second level `-` represent the list of images in this line.

**Know bug**: the images are left aligned, so if you don't put enough images on
a line, you'll have white space on the right.

#### Text

This displays some centered text as shown on the third position of the [example
gallery](http://psycojoker.github.io/prosopopee/first_gallery/). HTML is
allowed inside the text.

How to use it:

```yaml
  - type: text
    text: Some text, HTML <b>is allowed</b>.
```

#### Paragraph

This displays a h2 title followed by text. HTML is allowed inside of the text.
If no title is declared, a separator is added.

How to use it:

```yaml
  - type: paragraph
    title: the title
    text: Some text, HTML <b>is allowed</b>.
```

#### HTML

This section is for raw html that will be centered (for example: inlining an OSM iframe).

How to use it:

```yaml
  - type: html
    html: <tag>some html stuff</html>
```

#### Panorama

This displays a very large picture with a drag-and-drop possibility on it.

How to use it:

```yaml
  - type: panorama
    image: 7.jpg
```

### Example

As a recap, here is how the files of the example gallery are organised:

```
example
      ├── settings.yaml
      └── first_gallery
          ├── settings.yaml
          └── stuff.png
```

The content of <code>example/settings.yaml</code>:

```yaml
title: "Example gallery"
```

The content of <code>example/first_gallery/settings.yaml</code>:

```yaml
title: my first gallery
sub_title: some subtitle
date: 2015-12-08
cover: stuff.png
sections:
  - type: full-picture
    image: stuff.png
    text:
      title: Beautiful Title
      sub_title: pouet pouet
      date: 2015-12-08
  - type: bordered-picture
    image: stuff.png
  - type: text
    text: « voici plein de blabla à rajouter et <b>ceci est du gras</b> et encore plein plein plein plein de text car je veux voir comment ça va wrapper car c'est important et il faut pas que j'oublie de mettre des margins en % sinon ça va pas le faire alala là ça devrait aller »
  - type: pictures-group
    images:
      -
        - stuff.png
        - stuff.png
        - stuff.png
      -
        - stuff.png
        - stuff.png
  - type: full-picture
    image: stuff.png
```

## Build the website

**Note: You need to be in an activated virtualenv.**

In a folder containing the **root** settings.yaml file, simply do

    prosopopee

A `build` folder will be created in the current directory, containing an
index.html, static files (css & js) and pictures.

## TODO

* write documentation on how to overwrite the templates
* allow to overwrite static files (for that we need a merge mechanism)
* be mobile responsivepouetpouet (this mean css + resize pictures)
* probably moar sections + allows to add legends on pictures or something like that
* add `--source` & `--destination` command line options
* add rss/atom
