Sections
========

A gallery is composed of a succession of sections as you can see on this `wonderfully
totally uninteresting example
gallery <http://psycojoker.github.io/prosopopee/first_gallery/>`_. This gallery is
split in 5 sections:

* a full screen picture with text written on it
* a picture with borders around it
* a group of 5 pictures
* and a full-screen picture without text on it this time

In your settings.yaml, a section will **always** have a ``type`` key
that will describe its kind and additional data. Underneath, the
``type`` key is actually the name of an HTML template and the other
data will be passed to this template.

You can find all the section templates here: 

https://github.com/Psycojoker/prosopopee/tree/master/prosopopee/themes/exposure/templates/sections

You often have an ``image`` key. You need to give it a path to the
actual file. By convention, those files are put inside your gallery folder but
this is not mandatory.

Full Screen picture
___________________

This displays a full screen picture as shown in the `example
gallery <http://psycojoker.github.io/prosopopee/first_gallery/>`_ in the first
and last sections. How you should use it:

With text::

  - type: full-picture
    image: big_picture.jpg
    text:
      title: Big picture title
      sub_title: Some text
      date: 2016-01-15
      date_end: 2016-01-24 (Optional)

Without text::

  - type: full-picture
    image: big_picture.jpg
  
If you want a fixed background you can use this option (only with the exposure theme)::

  - type: full-picture
    fixed: true

The `background_position` setting can be used to control how the image is centered when
it doesn't fit the screen width. This is useful for controlling the center accross different
screen sizes (e.g. mobile), keeping the focal element of an image always visible.
This sets the `background-position` css property.
This feature is supported by the "exposure" theme.
Example::

  - type: full-picture
    image: big_picture.jpg
    background_position: 75%

Bordered picture
________________

This displays a centred picture that is surrounded by white (the background) as
shown in the second position of the `example
gallery <http://psycojoker.github.io/prosopopee/first_gallery/>`_.

How to use it::

  - type: bordered-picture
    image: another_picture.jpg

Group of pictures
_________________

This displays a group of zoomable pictures on one or multiple lines as shown on
the fourth position (after the text) of the `example
gallery <http://psycojoker.github.io/prosopopee/first_gallery/>`_::

  - type: pictures-group
    images:
      -
        - image1.jpg
        - image2.jpg
        - image3.jpg
      -
        - image4.jpg
        - image5.jpg

The first level `-` represents a row of pictures.
The second level `-` represents the list of images in this line.

**Known bug**: the images are left aligned, so if you don't put enough images on
a row, you'll have some white space on the right.

Text
____

This displays some centred text as shown on the third position of the `example
gallery <http://psycojoker.github.io/prosopopee/first_gallery/>`_. HTML is
allowed inside the text.

How to use it::

  - type: text
    text: Some text, HTML <b>is allowed</b>.

Paragraph
_________

This displays a h2 title followed by text. HTML is allowed inside the text.
If no title is declared, a separator is added.

How to use it::

  - type: paragraph
    title: the title
    text: Some text, HTML <b>is allowed</b>.

Since version 0.5 you can add a floating image in the paragraph::

  - type: paragraph
    title: the title
    text: Some text, HTML <b>is allowed</b>.
    image: 
      name: image.jpg
      float: right 
      size: 150px

By default if you don't set float and size the image will be on left with a size of 250px.
