Sections
========

A gallery is composed of a succession of sections as you can see on this [wonderfully
totally uninteresting example
gallery](http://psycojoker.github.io/prosopopee/first_gallery/) the gallery is
composed of 5 sections:

* a full screen picture with text written on it
* a picture with borders around it
* a group of 5 pictures
* and a fullscreen picture without text on it this time

In your settings.yaml, a section will **always** have a ``type`` key
that will describe its kind and additional data. Underneath, the
``type`` key is actually the name of an HTML template and the other
data will be passed to this template.

You can find all the sections templates here: https://github.com/Psycojoker/prosopopee/tree/master/prosopopee/templates/sections

You often have an ``image`` key. You need to give it a path to the
actual file. By convention, those files are put inside your gallery folder but
this is not mandatory.

Full Screen picture

This displays a full screen picture as shown in the [example
gallery](http://psycojoker.github.io/prosopopee/first_gallery/) in the first

________________

This displays a centered picture that is surrounded by white (the background) as
shown in the second position of the [example
gallery](http://psycojoker.github.io/prosopopee/first_gallery/).

Group of pictures
_________________

This displays a group of zoomable pictures on one or multiple lines as shown on
the fourth position (after the text) of the [example
gallery](http://psycojoker.github.io/prosopopee/first_gallery/)::

        - image5.jpg

The first level `-` represent a line of pictures.

a line, you'll have white space on the right.
