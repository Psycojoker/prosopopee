More or less a small clone of exposure.co in form of a static generator. 
For those of you who don't know what exposure.co is, this allows you to tell a story with your pictures.

You can find example usages here:

I wanted to learn a bit of advanced css and I wanted to self-host my data instead of using exposure.co.
